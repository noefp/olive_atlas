  RNA-seq of mature seeds sampled from ripe olives.
  Fruits were manually destoned and seeds were extracted by mechanical breakage of the woody endocarp. 
  The seed tissues (testa + endosperm and embryo) were dissected with a scalpel.

  Olive fruits were collected 210 days after anthesis from adult olive trees growing at 
  the Estación Experimental del Zaidín in Granada, Spain. 
  One biological replicate of Seed and three biological replicates of Testa+Endosperm and Embryo were sequenced.
  Data shown were normalized to TPM.
