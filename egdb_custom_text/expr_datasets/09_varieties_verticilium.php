  The plant samples employed for this study were collected at the World Olive Germplasm Bank at IFAPA Centro 'Alameda del Obispo'
  located in Córdoba province, Spain.
  Two biological replicates per sample were sequenced.
  cDNA libraries were sequenced by PE sequencing (100 x 2) with an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer and normalized to RPKM.
