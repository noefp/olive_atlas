<p>
  RNA-seq of pollen tube growth at four times of development.
  Pollen grains were pre-hydratated by incubation in a humid chamber at
  room temperature for 1 hour and then transferred to Petri dishes containing germination medium.
  Petri dishes were maintained at room temperature in the dark and under gentle agitation.
  Pollen grains were sampled at 1, 3 and 6 hours after transfer to the in vitro germination medium.
</p>
<h4>Experimental Conditions (3 biological replicates):</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Pollen mature. Mature rehydrated pollen.</li>
  <li>Pollen germ 1h. Pollen after 1 hour of germination.</li>
  <li>Pollen germ 3h. Pollen after 3 hours of germination.</li>
  <li>Pollen germ 6h. Pollen after 6 hours of germination.</li>
</ul>

  Images of Picual pollen grains at different stages of in vitro germination. From left to right, mature rehydrated pollen, and germinated pollen at 1, 3 and 6 hours of culture.

<p>
  Mature pollen grains were collected during the anthesis of adult olive trees growing at
  Estación Experimental del Zaidín in Granada, Spain. Three biological replicates per sample were sequenced and normalized to TPM.
