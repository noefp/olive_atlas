  The plant samples employed for this study were obtained from The plants were obtained from a commercial nursery located in Córdoba province, Spain.
  Two biological replicates per sample were sequenced.
  cDNA libraries were sequenced by PE sequencing (100 x 2) with an Illumina HiSeq 1000 sequencer and normalized to TPM.
